this is the explanation of the given code

firstly I created token name, token abbreviation and total supply.

then mapping is used to get the balance of the given adddress.

total supply is unsigned integer as its value can only be positive

then i created a mint function to add new address and update their values

after that i created a burn funtion to delete the address or deduct some balance
